description: "Define the objective of the desired end-state of your adversary engagement operations."
long_description: "The Operational Objective is  the goal(s) that drive all of the approaches and activities used in an adversary engagement operation. Articulating the operational objective allows the defender to align their actions to reach the desired end-state. There are three high-level Engagement Goals in adversary engagement operations: to Expose adversaries on the network, to Affect adversaries on the network, or to Elicit new information about adversaries.  These larger themes should help the defender create more focused operational objectives. For example, realistic operational objectives include: protecting a specific high-value technology or person by exposing adversaries targeting that technology or person, protecting against insider threats by affecting the adversary’s ability to steal sensitive data, or increasing the defender’s understanding of the threat landscape by eliciting new adversary TTPs, etc. Every action taken in the planning, execution, and analysis of an operation should be aligned with the operational objective. It is important to define this objective early on. Input from any involved stakeholders should be considered when choosing the operational objectives."
