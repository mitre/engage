description: "Manage peripheral devices used on systems within the network for engagement purposes."
long_description: "Peripheral Management is the administration of peripheral devices used on systems within the engagement environment. A defender can choose to allow or deny certain types of peripherals from being used on systems to either motivate or demotivate adversary activity or to direct the adversary towards specific targets. Defenders can also introduce peripherals to an adversary-controlled system to see how the adversary reacts. For example, the defender can introduce external Wi-Fi adapters, USB devices, etc. to determine if adversaries attempt to use them for exfiltration purposes.  Additionally, peripherals provide an avenue for the defender to present new or additional information to the adversary. This information can be used to introduce an additional attack surface, motivate or demotivate adversary activity, or to further the deception story. For example, the defender may include data on a connected USB device or stage an important conversation near an externally connected camera or microphone. Depending on the contents of this data, the adversary may be encouraged to take a specific action and/or reassured about the legitimacy of the environment."
