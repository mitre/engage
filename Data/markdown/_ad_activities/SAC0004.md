description: "The process of analyzing actionable knowledge about adversaries and their malicious activities, enabling defenders and their organizations to reduce harm through better security decision-making"
long_description: "Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) allows an organization to understand the threat landscape. CTI data can be informed by a combination of open and closed source research. Additionally, it can be supplemented with internal and external threat intelligence feeds, including information gleaned from previous engagement operations.  The understanding gained through CTI data allows the defender to identify and understand the target adversary for a given operation. For example, if the defenderâ€™s intended operational outcome is to expose adversaries on the network, the defender should prioritize adversaries that historically target their organization or similar organizations and/or have displayed TTPs that are likely to evade current defenses. Additionally, storyboarding should look at CTI data for the target adversary to make informed estimations on what the adversary may do in the environment and how they might react to what they find.  Once one or more adversaries have been selected as the target adversary, the relevant CTI data should guide the creation of the engagement environment and storyboard including hardware and software requirements, the required level of realism for lures and pocket Litter, and acceptable operational risk. This definition was based on the work presented by MITRE ATT&CK as seen here."
