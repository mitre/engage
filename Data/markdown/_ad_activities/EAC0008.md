description: "Exercise a target system in a manner where it will generate desirable system artifacts."
long_description: "Burn-In involves exercising the system to create desirable system artifacts such as web browsing history, file system usage, or the running of user applications. At times, Burn-In can be accomplished by simply letting a system or application run for an extended period of time. Other times, the defender engages with the environment to produce the Burn-In artifacts, such as when the defender logs into a decoy account or accesses a decoy website to generate session cookies and browser history. These tasks can be accomplished manually or via automated tooling.  Burn-In should occur pre-operation and continue as appropriate during the operation. The artifacts generated during the Burn-In process can reassure the adversary of the environmentâ€™s legitimacy by creating an environment that more closely resembles a real, lived in, system or network."
