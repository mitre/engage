description: "Design the systems and network for the operation."
long_description: "The Engagement Environment is the set of carefully tailored, highly instrumented systems designed on an engagement-by-engagement basis as the backdrop to the engagement narrative. It is the actual environment that the adversary will operate in. It is important to ensure that the Engagement Environment complements, rather than competes with, the engagement narrative. Additionally, these systems should provide conduits to allow the target adversary necessary movement throughout the environment, as needed to meet operational outcomes. <br><br>While not strictly part of the Engagement Environment, the collection system is the set of systems used to gather artifacts and other data from an operation to monitor the engagement to ensure operational safety. It is important to consider the collection system while designing the engagement environment. By designing these environments in lockstep, the defender guarantees that all aspects of the engagement environment can be monitored. This is essential to ensure operations remain within the guardrails set by the Rules of Engagement. For example, available resources, capabilities, or skills may limit the type of assets in, or size of, the engagement environment."
