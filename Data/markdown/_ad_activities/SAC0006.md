long_description: "The After Action Review (AAR) is the opportunity for the team to review the events of the operation to ensure progress towards strategic outcomes. This retrospective can include a review of the entire operational process from planning, implementation, execution, and impact. In addition to the operation itself, the AAR is an important time to assess the communication and teamwork of the operations team and all contributing stakeholders. While an AAR should always occur at the end of an operation, periodic reviews during long-running operations are vital to ensure alignment and progress towards the operational objectives."
