description: "Collect system activity logs that can reveal adversary activity."
long_description: "Capturing system logs can show logins, user and system events, etc. A defender can use such inherent system logging to study and collect first-hand observations about the adversary’s actions and tools.  This data can be sent to a centralized collection location for further analysis. Careful planning should be used to guide which system logs are collected and at what level. If the logging level is set too high or too many system logs are collected, the defender may be blinded by the excess data. For example, understanding the adversary’s known TTPs will highlight resources the adversary is likely to touch and therefore which system logs are likely to capture adversary activity.  Overall, System Activity Monitoring is essential to maintain situational awareness of adversarial activities in order to ensure operational safety and progress towards operational goals. Careful pre-operational planning should be done to properly instrument the engagement environment. This will ensure that all key network traffic is collected."
