description: "Alter security controls to make the system more or less vulnerable to attack."
long_description: "Manipulating Security Controls involves making configuration changes to a system’s security settings including modifying Group Policies, disabling/enabling autorun for removable media, tightening or relaxing system firewalls, etc. Such security controls can be tightened to dissuade or prevent adversary activity. Conversely, security controls can be weakened or left overly permissive to encourage or enable adversary activity.  Tightening security controls can typically be done by implementing any of the mitigations described in MITRE ATT&CK. See https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise/ for a full list of mitigation strategies. While loosening security controls may seem obvious (i.e., simply don’t employ a given mitigation strategy), there is an additional level of nuance that must be considered. Some security controls are considered so routine that its absence may be suspicious.  For example, completely turning off Windows Defender would likely raise the adversary’s suspicion. However, it is possible to turn off Windows Defender in certain shared drives to encourage adversary activity in predetermined locations. Therefore, it will likely be far less suspicious to turn off Windows Defender in a single directory or share. When assessing the likelihood that removing a given security control is overly suspicious, it is important to consider how prevalent that security control is, the target adversary’s sophistication, and the engagement narrative."
