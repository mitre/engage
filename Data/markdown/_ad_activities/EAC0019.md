description: "Identify key system elements to establish a baseline and be prepared to reset a system to that baseline when necessary."
long_description: "To determine the system Baseline, the defender must identify software and configuration elements that are critical to a set of objectives. The defender must define the proper values and be prepared to reset a running system to its intended state. Reverting to a Baseline configuration can be essential when restoring an operational environment to a safe state or when looking to impose a cost on adversaries by preventing their activity.  For example, the defender can watch for an adversary to make changes in the environment and then revert the environment with the goal of either forcing the adversary to target elsewhere in the network or to display a new, possibly more advanced, TTP. The Baseline values will also be crucial post-operation when analyzing changes to the environment over time."
