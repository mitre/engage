description: "Intentionally introduce vulnerabilities into the environment for the adversary to exploit."
long_description: "By intentionally Introducing Vulnerabilities into the engagement environment, the defender can attempt to motivate the adversary to target specific resources. This targeting may serve to move the adversary towards a particular resource, or away from another resource. At other times, the defender may Introduce Vulnerabilities as a mean of encouraging the adversary to reveal targeting preferences, available capabilities, or even to influence future targeting decisions. The operational objectives will drive how and why the defender Introduces Vulnerabilities in the engagement environment."
