_name: "Malware Detonation"
description: "Execute malware under controlled conditions to analyze its functionality."
long_description: "Malware can be detonated in a controlled and safe environment. Clear goals and safety procedures should always be established before detonation to ensure that the operation is focused and safe. The malware can be detonated in an execution environment ranging from a somewhat sterile commercial malware execution appliance to a bespoke engagement environment crafted to support an extended engagement.  Depending on operational objectives, the outcome of a malware detonation operation can include: collecting new IOCs during dynamic analysis,  observing additional TTPs by detonating the malware in a target rich environment, and/or negatively impacting the adversary and their operation."
