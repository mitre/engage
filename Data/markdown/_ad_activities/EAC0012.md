description: "Create fictitious human user(s) through a combination of planted data and revealed behavior patterns."
long_description: "A Persona is used to establish background information about a victim to increase the believability of the target. To create a Persona, the defender must develop a backstory and seed the environment with varying data in support of this story. Depending on the need for realism, the constructed persona can be supported by evidence of hobbies, social and professional interactions, consumer transactions, employment, browsing habits, etc.  In addition to lending legitimacy to the environment, personas can be used to engage directly with adversaries, such as during phishing email exchanges. Additionally, personas can make changes to the environment during the operation, such as adding or removing a USB device or introducing new decoy documents or credentials."
