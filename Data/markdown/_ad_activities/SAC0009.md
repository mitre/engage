description: "A risk assessment that models organizational strengths and weaknesses"
long_description: "Among other things, threat models require that the defender assesses the strengths, weaknesses, and importance of the their own organization, including trusted partners, infrastructure, and critical cyber assets. This understanding will inform operational objectives by outlining the defender’s attack surface and highlighting areas that may be of particular interest to a given adversary. The organization’s threat model should be understood at the onset of an operation to drive operational objective development and revisited at the conclusion of an operation to ensure operational outcomes are captured. These process of defining and informing the organization’s threat model should enable better security decision-making both in future operations and elsewhere in the organization."
