description: "Analyze network traffic to gain intelligence on communications between systems."
long_description: "Network analysis can be an automated or manual task to review communications between systems to expose adversary activity, such as C2 or data exfiltration traffic. This analysis is normally done by capturing and analyzing traffic on the wire or from previously collected packet capture.  When custom protocols are in use, defenders can leverage protocol decoder frameworks. These are customized code modules that can read network traffic and contextualize activity between the C2 operator and the implant. These frameworks are often required to process complex encryption ciphers and custom protocols into a human-readable format for an analyst to interpret. Decoder creation requires malware analysis of the implant to understand the design of the protocol. While a high level of technical maturity is required to create such a decoder, once created they are invaluable to the defender.  For example, a defender can use a protocol decode to decrypt network capture data and expose an adversary’s C2 or exfiltration activity. Not only does this data provide exquisite intelligence in regard to the adversary’s communications channels and targeting preferences, but it also provides future opportunities for data manipulation to further operational goals."
