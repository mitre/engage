long_description: "Lures are intended to elicit a particular response from the adversary. For example, the defender may utilize Lures to enable or block the adversaryâ€™s intended actions or encourage or discourage a specific action or response. Lures can take a variety of forms including credentials, accounts, files/directories, browser extensions/bookmarks, system processes, etc. Regardless of form, Lures provide opportunities to the defender to drive adversary behavior in ways that align with operational outcomes."
