description: "Conceal and reveal both facts and fictions to support a deception story"
long_description: "Information Manipulation is used to support the engagement narrative and directly impact adversary activities. Revealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the adversary’s trust in the environment. Concealed facts and fiction can be used to adjust the adversary’s sense of uncertainty towards the environment. Revealed facts may include OS type and version, geographic location, hardware type and version, accounts, credentials, etc. Revealed fictions may include the content of decoy files, emails, messages, etc. Revealed facts and fictions may or may not be believed by the adversary.  If an adversary believes a revealed fact or fiction, it may lend credibility to the environment or encourage a specific action. If an adversary is suspicious or does not believe a revealed fact or fiction, it may erode adversary trust in the environment or discourage a specific action. Therefore, revealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the adversary’s trust in the environment in ways that support the operational objectives.  <br><br>Concealed facts may include virtualized systems disguised as physical systems, monitoring software, or collection efforts. Concealed fictions may include an encrypted, interestingly named, decoy file or a partially deleted email thread referencing high value, but decoy, assets. Concealed facts and fictions may or may not be discovered by the adversary. If the adversary discovers a concealed fact or fiction, it may increase the ambiguity of the environment and affect the adversary’s sense of uncertainty.  In this way, concealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the ambiguity and affect the adversary’s sense of uncertainty in ways that support the operational objectives"
