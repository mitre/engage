description: "Make changes to a systemâ€™s software properties and functions to achieve a desired effect."
long_description: "Software Manipulation allows a defender to alter or replace elements of the OS, file system, or other software installed and executed on a system. These alterations can affect outputs, degrade effectiveness, and/or prevent the software from functioning altogether. For example, the defender can manipulate software by changing the output of commonly used discovery commands to hide legitimate systems and artifacts and/or reveal deceptive artifacts and systems.  Alternatively, the defender can change the output of the password policy description for an adversary attempting to brute-force credentials. This manipulation may cause the adversary to waste resources brute-forcing passwords with inaccurate complexity requirements. If the defender wanted to degrade software effectiveness, they might weaken algorithms to expose data that is being archived, encoded, and/or encrypted.  Finally, to prevent software from functioning altogether, the defender may cause failures in software typically used to delete data or hide adversary artifacts. For some Software Manipulation use cases, it may be possible to make changes in such a way that adversary actions and legitimate user actions are handled differently. For example, the defender could show all files when viewed in a graphical application but hide files or introduce decoy files when viewed via a terminal command. This setup would allow legitimate users full access to the file system, while manipulating access for adversaries using a reverse shell."
