description: "Make changes to network properties and functions to achieve a desired effect."
long_description: "Network Manipulation allows a defender to throttle network speeds, segment the network, maintain a unique IP addressing scheme, add a kill switch to cut off network access, etc. These types of manipulations can affect the adversaryâ€™s ability to achieve their operational objectives by incurring an increased resource cost, forcing them to change tactics, or stopping them altogether.  For example, a defender can limit the allowed ports or network requests to force the adversary to alter their planned C2 or exfiltration channels. As another example, a defender could allow or deny outbound SMB requests from a network to affect the success of forced authentication. Additionally, the defender can degrade network speeds and reliability to impose a resource cost as adversaries exfiltrate large quantities of data. Finally, a defender can block primary C2 domains and IPs to determine if the adversary has additional infrastructure. While there are a range of network manipulation options, in all cases, the defender has an opportunity to learn about or influence the adversaries operating in the environment."
