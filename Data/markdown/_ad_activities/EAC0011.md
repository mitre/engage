description: "Data used to support the engagement narrative."
long_description: "Pocket Litter is data placed on a system to help tell the engagement narrative, to increase the credibility of an environment, and/or to establish a cognitive bias to raise the adversary’s tolerance to weaknesses in the environment. Unlike Lures, Pocket Litter does not necessarily aim to encourage the adversary to take a specific action, but rather it supports the overall deception story.  Pocket Litter can include documents, pictures, registry entries, installed software, log history, browsing history, connection history, and other user data that an adversary would expect to exist on a user’s computer. For example, a defender might conduct a series of web searches to generate browser artifacts, or scatter a variety of photos and documents across the desktop to make the computer feel lived in."
