description: "Establish or maintain awareness regarding adversary activity."
long_description: "Detection activities focus on the defender’s ability to monitor adversary activity throughout an environment, often by creating high-fidelity detections. These detections can be produced in several ways. For example, a defender can deploy lures as tripwires in the environment. The defender may create custom alerts based on TTPs or IOCs observed during a malware detonation operation. Finally, the defender may write customer decoders to analyze and alert on malicious traffic.<br><br>In all these cases, detection activities allow the defender to produce a high-fidelity alert to monitor adversary activities. Often Detection activities are also good cybersecurity practices. However, in Engage, these activities will focus exclusively on the intersection of denial, deception, and adversary engagement technologies and the defender’s ability to Expose the adversary."
