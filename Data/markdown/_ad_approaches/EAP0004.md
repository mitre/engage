_name: "Direct"
description: "Encourage or discourage the adversary from conducting their operation as intended."
long_description: "Direction activities focus on moving the adversary towards or away from an intended path. This forced direction can be accomplished by removing or disabling some resources, while adding or enabling others. The defender can add lures or otherwise manipulate the environment to attempt to elicit specific responses from the adversary. Additionally, the defender can tighten some security controls while leaving others overly permissive or weakened. Finally, the defender can physically move the adversary by moving threats from their intended environment and into a safe engagement environment.  For example, a suspicious email attachment can be moved from the intended target to an engagement environment for analysis. No matter how the direction is achieved, the defender hopes to force the adversary to take unintended actions or stop intended actions."
