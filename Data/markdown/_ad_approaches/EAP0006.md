description: "Add authenticity to deceptive components to convince an adversary that an environment is real."
long_description: "Reassurance activities are used to add authenticity to deceptive components to reduce adversary suspicion about the legitimacy of the environment. Activities include adding realistic user accounts, files, system activity, and any other content that an adversary might expect to find on the system. These activities may add new artifacts, such as peripherals and pocket litter, while concealing others, such as how recently an environment was stood up. If done correctly, reassuring an adversary may help to make them  feel more comfortable upon landing in a new environment. This initial level of comfort can help anchor the adversary in the environment, increasing their tolerance to faults or weaknesses discovered later."
