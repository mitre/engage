<h1>ATT&CK® Groups Overview</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
    <p>
        By mapping the various Engagement Activities to ATT&CK, we can ensure that each activity in Engage is driven by observed adversary behavior. In adversary engagement operations it can be tempting to try to anticipate the adversary actions. However, without extensive understanding of the specific threat, this line of thinking can lead the defender to make incorrect or ineffective decisions. By mapping to ATT&CK, we can ensure that our chosen engagement activities are appropriate for the target adversary.
        <p>
        The following table provides a list of ATT&CK Groups with Mapped Enterprise ATT&CK Techniques. Each one links to a details page to show the ATT&CK Mapping entries that apply to that specific group.
