This understanding should include their current security posture, including known strengths and weaknesses, and an inventory of priority cyber assets, including key intellectual property. The defender should then examine and update the threat models for any identified adversaries.  These various assessments and models should enable the defender to identify their strategic goal.

This type of activity increases the adversary\u2019s time on target and wastes their resources. To drive down the value of stolen data, a defender could provide an adversary deliberately conflicting information.

Understand frames how raw operational outputs can be collected, synthesized, and used to inform future operations and defensive strategies. The Understand goal helps the defender to assess their progress towards Strategic Goals. At its core, the Understand goal ensures that operational outputs can connect to and inform a larger strategy. To do this, the defender must turn the raw outputs from an operation into useful and actionable intelligence. These outputs may be in the form of collected PCAP, logs, qualitative defender observations, etc. Applying analytics to raw data can help the defender to map this data to adversary behavior. Now the behavior can be analyzed to contextualize the intelligence and inform the existing threat model.  For example, the defender may look at raw PCAP data and identify a new IP address that the adversary uses for exfiltration. This IOC can be added to the existing threat model. After applying behavioral analytics to the data, the defender might see that the adversary used a new Defense Evasion technique. In that case, the defender should update the threat model to include this new intelligence. At this point, the defender should assess if this new intelligence will affect any ongoing operations. For example, the defender should ensure that current collection efforts will detect this new TTP. Other opportunities to increase the defender's understanding post-operation include efforts to refine and update individual engagement activities based on qualitative and quantitative outputs. The defender can reflect on how the overall engagement went and refine future activities to maximize the usefulness.  Finally, the defenders should assess their own coordination and communication.

Expose is about discovering previously undetected adversaries engaging in one of two behaviors. First, the adversary may be attempting to gain access to the networks. Second, the adversary may be currently operating on the networks. Both categories of adversary behavior contain vulnerabilities that can be advantageous for a defender seeking to expose the adversary.  As an example of such a vulnerability, when an adversary interacts with network or system resources, they are vulnerable to trigger tripwires. The defender can make and leak fake credentials both inside and outside of the network. The defender can then monitor for the use of these credentials. Then, when an adversary uses a fake credential, the defender will receive a high-fidelity alert. In addition, if the credentials are unique, a defender may be able to detect how and when an adversary collected the credentials. Whenever a defender seeks to engage with an adversary, operational safety is paramount.

The following table provides a list of ATT&CK Groups with Mapped Enterprise ATT&CK Techniques. Each one links to a details page to show the ATT&CK Mapping entries that apply to that specific group.    ATT&CK\u00ae Groups   ATT&CK\u00ae Group Description   APT-C-36 APT-C-36 is a suspected South America espionage group that has been active since at least 2018. The group mainly targets Colombian government institutions as well as important corporations in the financial sector, petroleum industry, and professional manufacturing.  APT1 APT1 is a Chinese threat group that has been attributed to the 2nd Bureau of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department\u2019s (GSD) 3rd Department, commonly known by its Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398.   APT12 APT12 is a threat group that has been attributed to China. The group has targeted a variety of victims including but not limited to media outlets, high-tech companies, and multiple governments.  APT18 APT18 is a threat group that has operated since at least 2009 and has targeted a range of industries, including technology, manufacturing, human rights groups, government, and medical.   APT19 APT19 is a Chinese-based threat group that has targeted a variety of industries, including defense, finance, energy, pharmaceutical, telecommunications, high tech, education, manufacturing, and legal services. In 2017, a phishing campaign was used to target seven law and investment firms.  Some analysts track APT19 and Deep Panda as the same group, but it is unclear from open source information if the groups are the same.     APT28 APT28 is a threat group that has been attributed to Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS) military unit 26165. This group has been active since at least 2004. APT28 reportedly compromised the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016 in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.  In 2018, the US indicted five GRU Unit 26165 officers associated with APT28 for cyber operations (including close-access operations) conducted between 2014 and 2018 against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the US Anti-Doping Agency, a US nuclear facility, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Spiez Swiss Chemicals Laboratory, and other organizations. Some of these were conducted with the assistance of GRU Unit 74455, which is also referred to as Sandworm Team.   APT29 APT29 is threat group that has been attributed to the Russian government and has operated since at least 2008.   This group reportedly compromised the Democratic National Committee starting in the summer of 2015.   APT3 APT3 is a China-based threat group that researchers have attributed to China's Ministry of State Security.   This group is responsible for the campaigns known as Operation Clandestine Fox, Operation Clandestine Wolf, and Operation Double Tap.   As of June 2015, the group appears to have shifted from targeting primarily US victims to primarily political organizations in Hong Kong. MITRE has also developed an APT3 Adversary Emulation Plan.  APT30 APT30 is a threat group suspected to be associated with the Chinese government. While Naikon shares some characteristics with APT30, the two groups do not appear to be exact matches.  APT32 APT32 is a threat group that has been active since at least 2014. The group has targeted multiple private sector industries as well as with foreign governments, dissidents, and journalists with a strong focus on Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. They have extensively used strategic web compromises to compromise victims. The group is believed to be Vietnam-based.  APT33 APT33 is a suspected Iranian threat group that has carried out operations since at least 2013. The group has targeted organizations across multiple industries in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, with a particular interest in the aviation and energy sectors.

This group has been active since at least 2004. APT28 reportedly compromised the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016 in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.  In 2018, the US indicted five GRU Unit 26165 officers associated with APT28 for cyber operations (including close-access operations) conducted between 2014 and 2018 against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the US Anti-Doping Agency, a US nuclear facility, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Spiez Swiss Chemicals Laboratory, and other organizations. Some of these were conducted with the assistance of GRU Unit 74455, which is also referred to as Sandworm Team.

The group has targeted a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East. It appears the group carries out supply chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets. FireEye assesses that the group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.       This group was previously tracked under two distinct groups, APT34 and OilRig, but was combined due to additional reporting giving higher confidence about the overlap of the activity.Disclaimer:  We present this mapping to stimulate thinking about engagement activities to take advantage of the historically observed behavior of adversary, not to present all possibilities.

The group has been active since at least 2009 and was reportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment as part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by Novetta. Malware used by Lazarus Group correlates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain.  In late 2017, Lazarus Group used KillDisk, a disk-wiping tool, in an attack against an online casino based in Central America. North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and the name Lazarus Group is known to encompass a broad range of activity. Some organizations use the name Lazarus Group to refer to any activity attributed to North Korea. Some organizations track North Korean clusters or groups such as Bluenoroff, APT37, and APT38 separately, while other organizations may track some activity associated with those group names by the name Lazarus Group.Disclaimer:  We present this mapping to stimulate thinking about engagement activities to take advantage of the historically observed behavior of adversary, not to present all possibilities. We invite you to use this as a guide, understanding that adversary behavior is constantly changing and evolving.

They initially targeted defense and aviation companies but shifted to focus to include the energy sector in early 2013. They have also targeted companies related to industrial control systems. A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as Dragonfly 2.0. There is debate over the extent of the overlap between Dragonfly and Dragonfly 2.0, but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate groups.

Learn More MITRE Engage seeks to help the CISOs, and other security decision makers, understand how denial, deception, and adversary engagement fit into the organization\u2019s current cyber strategy. To get started, click here to familiarize yourself with the Engage structure and terminology. We at MITRE are strong believers that cyber deception technologies, unlike many other defensive technologies, are not \u201cfire and forget.\u201d Rather, deception technologies should be deployed as part of an intentional strategy that drives toward well understood goals. As such, Engage is designed to help decision makers:   Create policies and procedures for safe network operation and response to incidents. Engage introduces planning and adapting as fundamental components of the framework. While planning and adapting are CISO functions, the practitioner needs know how activities like collection, reassurance, and motivation can lead to the detection of incidents.   Reduce risks to information and related technologies. Engage lays out activities to support the detection, prevention, direction, and disruption of adversaries. We believe that employing these activities can support the mission of risk reduction.   Protect information and assets. While denial activities limit an adversary\u2019s access to legitimate information, deception performs an additional protection mechanism. Providing misinformation about systems or data can decrease the trust or value an adversary puts into those assets. Decreasing value and trust typically will cause an adversary to avoid those objects.    How Engage Can Help Achieve Your Security Objectives We recommend the following steps for decision makers interested in furthering exploring what Engage can do to enhance cybersecurity strategies:   Step 1: Explore how Engage uses Goals, Approaches, and Activities to drive progress towards strategic cyber outcomes.    Take a look at the Matrix view. This provides a picture of the relationships across all of the Strategic and Engagement Goals, Approaches, and Activities.      Step 2: Understand the Prepare Goal.    Read the definitions for each of the Strategic Approaches and Activities under Prepare. These Activities focus on identifying all of the information that needs to be gathered before an operation has started. Successfully completing these Activities will ensure that all key stakeholders have been engaged and that all future activities are informed by a threat model that is as complete as possible.      Step 3: Define your desired outcomes.    Review the Engagement Goals. Do you want to Expose adversaries on the network to reveal previously unknown threats? Do you want to Affect adversaries by imposing a negative resource cost?  Or do you want to Elicit adversary TTPs to generate a CTI feed or to inform other defenses? By selecting an Engagement Goal early in your operational planning, Engage helps the defender ensure that operations remain focused and driving forward progress.      Step 4: Understand the Understand Goal.    Review Approaches and Activities under Understand. These actions ensure that the various raw data outputs from the operation are distilled into actionable intelligence. This intelligence can then be fed back into future operations and used to inform other defenses. By bookending activities in the context of strategic planning and analysis, Engage seeks to provide cybersecurity decision makers the framework they need to understand the goals of deception and how to drive progress towards those goals."}, {"id": 147, "title": "MITRE Engage Structure", "path": "/resources/structure.html", "content": "MITRE Engage Terminology A goal for Engage was to employ enough structure and rigor to be useful scientifically to the practitioner, without becoming needlessly rigid or complex. We began with terminology found in the DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, as well as the United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms. We modified those terms to fit the domain of cyber-based adversary engagement:   Adversary Engagement: Engagement is the combination of denial and deception to increase the cost and decrease the value of the adversary\u2019s cyber operations. The goal of adversary engagement is to expose adversaries and their weaknesses, learn about their capabilities and intentions, and impose costs on them.   Cyber Denial: Denial is the ability and effort to prevent or impair the collection of intelligence by an adversary.Heckman2015. Denial also supports the prevention or disruption of and adversary\u2019s attempt at achieving effects.   Cyber Deception: The deceiver reveals deceptive facts and fictions to mislead the opponent, while concealing critical facts and fictions to prevent the opponent from forming the correct estimates or taking appropriate actionsHeckman2015.   Goals: The big objective you would like to accomplish.   Approaches: The method you use to make progress towards your goal. Engage uses the term Approaches to refer to Tactics like those described in ATT&CK\u00ae. we use the term Approaches instead of Tactics to disambiguate when we refer Engage Approaches versus ATT&CK\u00ae Tactics.   Activities: The concrete activity you use to make progress towards your approach. Engage uses the term Activities to refer to Techniques like those described in ATT&CK\u00ae. We use the term Activities instead of Techniques to disambiguate when we refer Engage Activities versus ATT&CK\u00ae Techniques.   Strategic Actions: The goals, approaches, and activities that are undertaken to support your operational strategy.   Engagement Actions: The goals, approaches, and activities that are undertaken against your adversary.   MITRE Engage Matrix Structure The Engage Matrixconsists of the following core components:  Across the top of the matrix are the Engage Goals. The next row down contains the Engage Approaches. The remainder of the matrix is composed of the Engage Activities.  These actions are divided into two categories:  Strategic goals, approaches, and activities bookend the matrix and ensure that defenders appropriately drive operations with strategic planning and analysis. Engagement goals, approaches, and activities are the traditional cyber denial and deception activities that are used to drive progress towards the defender\u2019s strategic goals. There are a number of vendor products designed to assist the defender to implement these activities.  MITRE Engage ID Format Every Goal, Approach, and Activity has a unique ID.  Strategic GOals begin with SGO Engagement GOals begin with EGO Strategic APproaches begin with SAP Engagement APproaches begin with EAP Strategic ACtivities begin with SAC Engagement ACtivities begin with EAC  MITRE Engage ATT&CK\u00ae Mappings By mapping the various Engagement Activities to ATT&CK\u00ae, we can ensure that each activity in Engage is driven by observed adversary behavior. Each mapping is broken down as follows:  ATT&CK ID & Name \u2013 The ATT&CK Technique ID and Name: The specific adversary behavior we are looking at Adversary Vulnerability: The vulnerability that the adversary exposes when they engage in the specified behavior Engagement Activity:  The action the defender can take to take advantage of the vulnerability the adversary has exposed  In our first release of MITRE Engage we have chosen not to include any specific activity implementations or use cases in these mappings. To provide some guidance, we have included expanded definitions for each Activity including concrete examples. We hope these definitions will provide some examples of the art of the possible. If you have questions, please reach out! We would be happy to share our past operational implementations or discuss your ideas. In the future, we hope to find new ways to dive into specific implementations, including collecting open source examples of activity implementations, either from vendor products or individual practitioners."}, {"id": 148, "title": "Terms of Use", "path": "/resources/terms-of-use.html", "content": "TERMS OF USE Your use of MITRE Engage\u2122 hosted on GitHub\u00ae and accessed via this website (Site) is subject to certain terms and conditions.

MITRE Engage replaces the MITRE Shield knowledge base. Based on technical feedback from the cyber community, we've streamlined Shield to focus on the areas of denial, deception, and adversary engagement. By bookending these Engagement Activities with strategic planning and analysis, we hope that MITRE Engage will help organizations to better plan and implement real-world adversary engagement strategies. We're aware that the change from Shield to Engage will create the need for major re-design of processes and tooling. We think these changes are necessary to help cyber practitioners, leaders, and vendors understand the tools and strategies available to them to build adversary engagement operations. To ensure that MITRE Engage keeps a focus on strategic planning, we have implemented the following changes:   Decreased the number of activities and, in places, broadened the scope of individual activities. For example, we have folded the Shield Techniques of Decoy Account, Decoy Content, Decoy Credentials, Decoy Process, and Decoy Systems into a single Activity: Decoy Artifacts and Systems. Each of these Shield Techniques may look very different in implementation. However, we believe the reason a defender may utilize one of them, and the effect the activity may have on the adversary, is shared across the various implementations. For example, a defender may use a Decoy Account or Decoy Content as a tripwire. In either case, the defender hopes to expose adversary movement. This release of Engage seeks to abstract away, to a degree, activity implementations to allow the defender to focus on how the activity can impact the adversary and drive progress towards an intended outcome. In future Engage releases we hope to provide more details into specific implementations of a given Activity.   Removed the concepts of Procedures, Use Cases, and Opportunity Spaces. These changes were an intentional adjustment to remove the focus from individual activities, and instead, focus on how these activities fit into the context of larger strategic objectives. Once we have fully fleshed out this emphasis on strategic planning and analysis, we would like to revisit the idea of Engagement Activities to expand the knowledge base and provide a deeper dive into various implementations and opportunities each activity offers. In the very near future, we would like to introduce the concept of References. References are intended to provide proven, real-world examples of Activity implementations. We are looking to the community to help curate these References. Click here to learn more about how to contribute References and other data to Engage.   Changed the terms Tactics and Techniques to Approaches and Activities. We wanted to remove any confusion between what we call Approaches and Activities in Engage versus ATT&CK Tactics or Techniques. Additionally, we have added the concept of Goals as a layer above Approaches. We have also divided the Engage Goals, Approaches, and Activities into two categories: Strategic actions and Engagement actions. All these changes were made in order to build strategic planning into the foundation of Engage. For full definitions for each of these actions, click here.   Added the concept of Adversary Vulnerabilities. Adversary Vulnerabilities are the weaknesses an adversary unintentionally exposes when they engage in a particular behavior. The defender has an opportunity to impact the adversary by taking advantage of such a vulnerability. We have chosen to include Adversary Vulnerabilities in place of Opportunity Spaces to make adversary behavior a focal point of Engage. We feel that this framing helps the defender keep the adversary, and the adversary's behavior, at the center of every operation.   Why Did We Make These Changes? We feel strongly that strategic planning and analysis must be foundational components of every adversary engagement operation. MITRE Engage allows the defender to view the same expertise captured in the Shield knowledge base through this lens of planning and analysis. Why the Name Change? While Shield was an active defense knowledge base, MITRE Engage has tightened the focus exclusively to denial, deception, and adversary engagement. We feel that the name Engage more accurately represents this new, more streamlined focus. How Do I Switch from Shield to Engage? As we transition from MITRE Shield to MITRE Engage, you may be asking yourself, \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d Below is a step-by-step guide for transitioning from Shield to Engage.  Implement key changes to the Engage structure:  Tactics have been renamed Approaches Techniques have been renamed Activities Goals have been added as a category above Approaches Each of these categories has been broken into two sets with unique IDs, Strategic Goals/Approaches/Activities and Engagement Goals/Approaches/Activities. The overall structure is: Activities are a subset of Approaches, Approaches are a subset of Goals.   Remap all the Activities.  Please note that Approaches have changed significantly from Shield\u2019s original Tactics. With the addition of Goals, we made big changes that make a one-to-one mapping from Tactics to Approaches difficult. Adding Goals as a super category allowed us to make each Approach more focused. As a result, we were able to reduce much of the overlap seen in Shield. While we believe the pros outweigh the cons, we recognize that this makes the conversion from Tactic to Approach more challenging. In the end we believe the change will provide greater clarity and ease of understanding. We provide three forms of translation tables or \"crosswalks\" from our previous release Technique IDs to the Engage Activity IDs to help with the transition. The three CSVs are:  Shield_ID_crossover.csv: a mapping of each Technique in Shield to its current state in Engage (Does not include Activities that are new to Engage) Engage_ID_crossover.csv: a mapping of each Activity in Engage to its past state in Shield (Does not include Techniques that have been deprecated in Engage) All_crossover.csv: A mapping of each Technique and Activity with information about both Shield and Engage  We have also created a JSON representation of each CSV for greater machine readability:  CSV Files JSON  We have identified the following 5 key types of changes when mapping Techniques to Activities:  Technique Became Activity New Activity Added Multiple Techniques Became Activity Technique Name was Changed Technique Name was Changed and Scope Broadened Deprecated  Each of these types of changes is represented in the \"Change Type\" column of the CSVs or \"change-type\" field in the JSON. Some of these changes are simpler to implement than others. To help with the transition, we've outlined six tips on how to move from Shield to Engage. Step 1: Start with the easy to remap activities first and automate.  For content mapped to Shield, start by replacing the existing technique ID from the value in the \"TID\" column with the value in the \"New ID\" column if there is one. Next, update the technique name to match the value in \"New Activity Name.\" This remap fixes the majority of the changes for Technique Became Activity, Technique Name was Changed, Technique Name was Changed and Scope was Broadened, as well as Multiple Techniques Became Activity. We'll handle the remaining two cases in Step 2. In cases where the scope of the Activity was broadened, it's also worth checking the \"Note\" field in the CSV and \"explanation\" in the JSON. Technique Became Activity For Techniques labeled \"Technique Became Activity\" the name is the same in Engage as in it was in Shield but note that the definitions and IDs will be new. For example, Detonate Malware (Shield: DTE0018) remains Detonate Malware (Engage: EAC0013). New Activity Added No mappings from previous Techniques will be impacted. Examples of new Activities include Information Manipulation (EAC0015) and Storyboarding (SAC0003). Multiple Techniques Became New Activity For Techniques labeled \"Multiple Techniques Became New Activity,\" a new Activity was created covering the scope and content of multiple previous Techniques. For example, Decoy Account (Shield ID: DTE0010), Decoy Content (Shield ID: DTE0011), Decoy Credentials (Shield ID: DTE0012), Decoy Process (Shield ID: DTE0016), and Decoy Systems (Shield ID: DTE0017) merged into Decoy Artifacts and Systems (EAC0005). Technique Name was Changed For Techniques labeled \"Technique Name was Changed,\" a new Activity was created covering the same scope and content of a previous Technique with a new name. For example, Decoy Persona (Shield ID: DTE0015) is now Personas (EAC0012). Technique Name was Changed and Scope was Broadened For Techniques labeled \"Technique Name was Changed,\" a new Activity was created covering a larger scope and content from a previous Technique with a new name. For example, PCAP Collection (Shield ID: DTE0028) is a component of Network Monitoring (EAC0002). Step 2: Look at the deprecated Techniques to see what changed. This is where some manual effort will be required. Deprecated techniques are not as straightforward. For techniques labeled as \"Deprecated,\" we removed them from Engage without replacing them because we felt they did not fit into Engage. Often, these activities focused more broadly on good cyber hygiene practices, which are no longer in scope for Engage. For example, User Training (Shield ID: DTE0035) was removed because we felt this practice was not within the tighter scope of denial, deception, and adversary engagement. Step 3: Review if the New Goals Categories Change Your Mappings. If you want to take full advantage of Engage, it is important to consider each goal in the context of a given goal it is mapped to. The implementation behind a given activity is influenced greatly by the goal it is mapped to. For example, Decoy Artifacts and Systems maps to both Expose and Affect. A Decoy Artifact intended to expose the adversary may be an interesting document with a tripwire. On the other hand, a Decoy Artifact mean to Affect an adversary may be an interesting document that is so large the adversary wastes time attempting to encrypt and exfiltrate the artifact. In both cases, the Decoy Artifact is an interesting document in the environment, but the differing goals result in different implementations of the document (one document has a tripwire, one is massive in size). Make sure each of your existing mappings accurately reflects not only the Activity definition, but also the corresponding Approach and Goal definitions. Moving Forward Although previous versions of Shield will remain available on GitHub for the time being, new content will only be added to Engage. We look forward to exploring all the new opportunities these improvements provide. We would like to thank everyone that made these exciting changes possible, including the Engage and Shield Teams (past and present) and the amazing community for your continuous feedback and support.

Engage provides the cyber defender with a common language for planning and discussing engagement operations. Learn More Whether you are planning to run a single operation for research purposes or intend to undertake a series of operations to generate a continuous threat intelligence feed, MITRE Engage can help. If you have not already, click here for a full exploration of the structure and terminology you will find in Engage. Now that you understand the basic terms and structure of Engage, let\u2019s see one example of how a defender could use this framework to plan and run an operation. This process was adapted from the process described by Barton Whaley in the Art and Science of Military Deception.    Step 0: Assess knowledge of your adversaries and your organization.    The defender should Develop a Threat Model of both the target adversary and their organization. A target adversary represent a threat that historically targets your organization or organizations like yours. The target adversary may represent a gap in the your threat intelligence orr they may be known to historically utilize TTPs that represent a gap in the your's current defenses. Regardless of the reason, you should have solid understanding of both the adversary and their own organiztion.      Step 1: Determine your strategic goal.    Using the previously developed Threat Model, you must now identify your Strategic Goal. Every operation will have a unique Strategic Goal. This goal might be to Expose adversaries on the network to reveal previously unknown threats, to Affect adversaries by imposing a negative resource cost, or to Elicit adversary TTPs by encouraging the adversary to reveal new or more advanced behaviors or capabilities. This goal will drive every action you take from this point forward.      Step 2: Determine what you want your adversary to do.    Guided by the chosen Strategic Goal and using the previously developed Threat Model, you can use the Engage ATT&CK\u00ae Mappings to examine the various Tactics and Techniques associated with the adversary. For every Technique, we have identified one or more adversary vulnerabilities that are exposed, and the Engagement activity you can utilize to take advantage of the vulnerability. Using these mappings, you can begin to create the operational Storyboard. This outline should help identify what activities you will use to encourage the adversary to take the desired actions.      Step 3: Determine what you want them to perceive.    Still guided by the chosen Strategic Goal, and using the previously developed Threat Model, you can continue to expand the Storyboard by creating the Personas and related story elements required to control what is communicated to the adversary. While you cannot control what the adversary thinks, you can use the developed Threat Model, Strategic Goal, and Storyboard to shape what the adversary will find in the environment.      Step 4: Determine presentation avenues for your adversary.    Now you must decide what the adversary will find in the environment. You should examine the various Approaches and Activities described under their selected Engagement Goal in the Matrix to identify which activities you will utilize. You must determine how these activities will be implemented. Additionally, you must determine if a given activity will be revealed to or concealed from the adversary. For example, you may reveal a Decoy Document to the adversary while concealing the fact that you Manipulated Software to serve as a tripwire to detect adversary movement.      Step 5: Determine the exit criteria.    In order to maintain operational safety and to ensure that operations remain focused on the chosen Strategic Goal, you must identify key Exit Criteria. Sometimes, these events include the successful completion of the agreed upon goals. Other times, these events may signify the operation has reached a hard stop. This is often because future operational safety cannot be guaranteed or because events have occurred that outweigh the agreed upon acceptable risk. Finally, it may just be that if the adversary operates any longer, they may learn something we don't want them to know. It is important to engage stakeholders across various roles and skillsets to identify these criteria.      Step 6: Execute your operation.    Deploy the monitoring, engagement, and analysis activities. And wait. Note: depending on the specifics of the engagement, an operation may take time! *Note: Steps 7-9 may happen continuously throughout an operation to ensure incremental refinements*      Step 7: Turn raw data into actionable intelligence.    You must gather all of the various data outputs. These may be in the form of logs, PCAP, NetFlow, etc. You should feed this data into an analytics pipeline to ensure that the data can be used to provide actionable intelligence. This intelligence may be in the form of new IOCs, TTPs, etc.      Step 8: Feed back intelligence.    Any intelligence produced during the operation should be used to Inform the Threat Model and Refine Operational Activities. If applicable, this intelligence should inform, not only future operations, but also the larger defensive strategy of your organization.      Step 9: Analyze your successes & failures.    Finally, it is essential to examine all of the operational activities to assess successes and failures. The results of these assessments should Refine Future Operation Activities.

Revealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the adversary\u2019s trust in the environment. Concealed facts and fiction can be used to adjust the adversary\u2019s sense of uncertainty towards the environment. Revealed facts may include OS type and version, geographic location, hardware type and version, accounts, credentials, etc. Revealed fictions may include the content of decoy files, emails, messages, etc. Revealed facts and fictions may or may not be believed by the adversary.  If an adversary believes a revealed fact or fiction, it may lend credibility to the environment or encourage a specific action. If an adversary is suspicious or does not believe a revealed fact or fiction, it may erode adversary trust in the environment. For example, if the adversary discovers that a collection of legitimate passwords all contain the phrase \"honeytoken\" or \"canarytoken\" they may lose trust in the legitimacy of the environment, even if the credentials are real and valid in the enterprise network. Conversely, if the adversary checks the timestamps on various files on the target and finds timestamps going back multiple years, they may trust that the environment is legitimate even if, in reality, the files are new and the timestamps were falsified. In this way, revealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the adversary's trust in the environment in ways that support the defender's goals.  Concealed facts may include virtualized systems disguised as physical systems, monitoring software, or collection efforts. Concealed fictions may include an encrypted, interestingly named, decoy file or a partially deleted email thread referencing high value, but decoy, assets. Concealed facts and fictions may or may not be discovered by the adversary. If the adversary discovers a concealed fact or fiction, it may increase the ambiguity of the environment and affect the adversary's sense of uncertainty.  For example, if an adversary discovers a hidden monitoring solution is deployed, they may feel less comfortable engaging with that specific target. Conversely, if the defender deploys a hidden monitoring solution with an intentional blind spot that the adversary discovers, the adversary may feel a decrease in ambiguity and take additional actions believing that they will be undetected. In this way, concealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the ambiguity and affect the adversary's sense of uncertainty in ways that support the defender's goals.

Software Manipulation allows a defender to alter or replace elements of the OS, file system, or any other software installed and executed on a system. These alterations can affect outputs, degrade effectiveness, and/or prevent the software from functioning altogether. For example, the defender can manipulate software by changing the output of commonly used discovery commands to hide legitimate systems and artifacts and/or reveal decoy artifacts and systems.  Alternatively, the defender can change the output of the password policy description for an adversary attempting to brute-force credentials. This manipulation may cause the adversary to waste resources brute-forcing passwords with inaccurate complexity requirements. If the defender wanted to degrade software effectiveness, they might weaken algorithms to expose data that is being archived, encoded, and/or encrypted.  Finally, to prevent software from functioning altogether, the defender may cause software typically used to delete data or hide adversary artifacts to fail. For some Software Manipulation use cases, it may be possible to make changes in such a way that adversary actions and legitimate user actions are handled differently. For example, the defender could show all files when viewed in a graphical application but hide files or introduce decoy files when viewed via a terminal command.

The pattern of life can include behaviors such as using email or chat software, browsing the Internet, using system software, or physically moving the device (particularly important for mobile devices and laptops).  The defender must determine how the Persona's behavior and other events in the environment will be generated. Personas may be generated automatically with tooling, manually with human operators, or some combination of both. The availability of defender resources may greatly impact the frequency of manually executing behaviors.  Not every action taken in the environment needs to be planned in advance.

Developing a Threat Model allows the potential target adversary to be identified and understood. This model should be informed by a combination of open and closed source research.

Additionally, in order to build the model, the defender must have a thorough understanding of themselves. Among other things, this includes their own organization, trusted partners, infrastructure, current security strengths and weaknesses, and critical cyber assets. This understanding will inform the threat modeling by outlining the defender's attack surface and highlighting areas that may be of particular interest to a given adversary. The threat model output from this analysis should include information about the adversary's TTPs, IOCs, victimology, and level of sophistication.  Applying the Strategic Goal to these models allows the defender to prioritize target adversaries. For example, if the defender's intended operational outcome is to expose adversaries on the network, the defender should prioritize adversaries that historically target their organization or similar organizations and have displayed TTPs that are likely to evade current defenses. Additionally, Storyboarding should use the threat model for the target adversary to anticipate what the adversary will do in the environment, how they will react to what they find, and what the defender plans to do in response.  Once one or more adversaries have been selected as the target adversary, the corresponding threat model should guide the creation of the engagement environment and storyboard including hardware and software requirements, the required level of realism for Decoy Artifacts and Pocket Litter, and acceptable operational risk.

A personal computer with no work information? Some mix of both?), and geographic location. Often, and especially for a short-term engagement operation, these persona traits can be fairly broad.  For example, it is unlikely that a persona used in a short-term ransomware detonation operation would require a lot of details to be effective. However, for a longer-term insider threat protection operation, the defender may need to create a persona with the online presence of a corporate employee, including name, birthday, address, etc. Many factors should be considered when determining how in-depth a persona should be, including adversary sophistication, defender resources, and deception story.

Decoy Artifacts and Systems allow the defender to increase the attack surface of their environment to expose more of the deception story. Additionally, they can be used to adjust the adversary\u2019s sense of ambiguity to increase or decrease their level of uncertainty towards the environment. Investigation of these decoy artifacts may introduce a resource cost on the adversary, enable or block the adversary's intended actions, encourage or discourage a specific action or response, etc.  Decoy artifacts can take a variety of forms including credentials, accounts, files/directories, browser extensions/bookmarks, system processes, etc. Decoy systems can be real, virtual, or simulated. They can be presented as one of a variety of IT devices, including user workstations, servers, networking systems, IOT (embedded devices), mobile devices, etc. Regardless of form, these decoy artifacts and systems provide a variety of opportunities for the defender. For example, decoy artifacts can be used as tripwires to produce a high-fidelity alert when accessed.  Careful planning should guide the creation and deployment of these tripwires to ensure effectiveness. For example, understanding the adversary's known TTPs will highlight which resources the adversary is likely to touch, and therefore where decoy artifacts should be placed. A thorough assessment of the defender's priority cyber assets and intellectual property should guide the placement of decoy artifacts used as tripwires.  A decoy artifact can provide several means to influence adversary activity. The following examples illustrate the powerful effects decoy artifacts and systems can have on the adversary. First, by planting decoy artifacts and systems that align with known adversary TTPs, the defender can influence adversary activities. For example, if a target adversary has a capability against a specific application, the defender can place this vulnerable application in the environment to motivate the adversary to exploit the decoy.  As a second example, a defender may install AV or some other security or monitoring tool in a way that is easy for the adversary to remove. If an adversary removes the tool, they may be emboldened to act more openly believing they can\u2019t be monitored.  The defender can attempt to demotivate the adversary by strategically placing decoy artifacts. For example, a defender could place a selection of reverse engineering tools or monitoring applications on a known vulnerable target. This may sow confusion and raise ambiguity, demotivating the adversary\u2019s desire to go after that target even if it is vulnerable.  Planting decoy artifacts and systems in the environment can influence the adversary to reveal the extent of successive campaigns against a target. For example, the defender can make and leak fake credentials both inside and outside of the network. The defender can then monitor for the use of these credentials. Then, when an adversary uses a fake credential, the defender will receive a high-fidelity alert. If the credentials are unique, a defender may be able to detect how and when an adversary collected the credentials.  Finally, decoy artifacts can be used to impose a resource cost on the adversary. For example, the defender can create an especially enticing, but excessively large, decoy file that is time and resource consuming to exfiltrate from the target.

Revisiting operational decisions is particularly important when the update to the threat model is related to new TTPs.  For example, suppose an adversary is observed demonstrating a previously unknown TTP. Any operation currently focused on this threat should be reassessed. Defenders should ensure that collection is adequate to monitor this new TTP and continue to ensure operational safety.

The Strategic Goal is the big picture objective that drives all of the approaches and activities used in an adversary engagement operation. The Strategic Goal allows the defender to align all actions to reach the desired end-state. There are three high-level strategic goals in adversary engagement operations: to Expose adversaries on the network, to Affect adversaries on the network, or to Elicit new information about adversaries.  These big strategic outcomes can support objectives such as protecting a specific high-value technology or person by exposing adversaries targeting that technology or person, protecting against insider threats by affecting the adversary's ability to steal sensitive data, or increasing the defender's understanding of the threat landscape by eliciting new adversary TTPs, etc. Every action taken in the planning, execution, and analysis of an operation should be aligned with the strategic goal. Therefore, it is important to define this goal early on. Input from any involved stakeholders should be considered when choosing the strategic goal.

In adversary engagement operations it can be tempting to try to anticipate the adversary actions. However, without extensive understanding of the specific threat, this line of thinking can lead the defender to make incorrect or ineffective decisions. By mapping to ATT&CK, we can ensure that our chosen engagement activities are appropriate for the target adversary. In the below table, each approach in the ATT&CK framework is shown individually. Clicking on a specific approach will show a detail page with the following information:  ATT&CK ID & Name \u2013 The ATT&CK Technique ID and Name Adversary Vulnerability \u2013 The vulnerability that the adversary exposes when they engage in a specific behavior Engagement Activity \u2013 The action the defender can take to take advantage of the vulnerability the adversary has exposed  When an adversary engages in a specific behavior, they are vulnerable expose an unintended weakness. By looking at each ATT&CK activity, we can examine the weaknesses revealed and identify an engagement activity or activities to exploit this weakness.  In our first release of MITRE Engage we have chosen not to include any specific activity implementations or use cases in these mappings. To provide some guidance, we have included expanded definitions for each Activity including concrete examples. We hope these definitions will provide some examples of the art of the possible. If you have questions, please reach out! We would be happy to share our past operational implementations or discuss your ideas.  In the future we hope to find new ways to dive into specific implementations, including collecting open source examples of activity implementations either from vendor products or individual practitioners.
