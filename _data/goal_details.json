First, the adversary may be attempting to gain access to the networks. Second, the adversary may be currently operating on the networks. Both categories of adversary behavior contain vulnerabilities that can be advantageous for a defender seeking to expose the adversary. <br><br>\n\nAs an example of such a vulnerability, when an adversary interacts with network or system resources, they are vulnerable to trigger tripwires. The defender can make and leak fake credentials both inside and outside of the network. The defender can then monitor for the use of these credentials. Then, when an adversary uses a fake credential, the defender will receive a high-fidelity alert. In addition, if the credentials are unique, a defender may be able to detect how and when an adversary collected the credentials. Whenever a defender seeks to engage with an adversary, operational safety is paramount. To maintain this safety, it is a best practice to monitor adversaries as they operate in an engagement environment. Additionally, the defender must be able to observe the adversary. Therefore, collection and detection activities can often be utilized even when a defender may have other strategic goals in mind. <br><br>\n\nEngage defines two approaches to make progress towards the Expose goal.<ul><li>Collection allows the defender to capture and review data that the adversary produces during their operations. </li><li>Detection takes this collected data and turns it into an alert that the defender can use to their advantage.</li></ul> In many cases, the activities that support such Collection and Detection approaches are also good cybersecurity practices.

The defender may want to increase the adversary\u2019s cost to operate or drive down the value they derive from their operations. For example, the defender can negatively impact the adversary\u2019s on-network operations to drive up the resource cost of doing operations by slowing down or selectively resetting connections to impact exfiltration. This type of activity increases the adversary\u2019s time on target and wastes their resources. To drive down the value of stolen data, a defender could provide an adversary deliberately conflicting information. Providing such information requires an adversary to either choose to believe one piece of data over another, disregard both, collect more data, or continue with uncertainty. <br><br>\n\nAll these options increase operational costs and decrease the value of collected data.

To support this aim, the defender must first generate a clear picture of their organization and the threat landscape. This understanding should include their current security posture, including known strengths and weaknesses, and an inventory of priority cyber assets, including key intellectual property. The defender should then examine and update the threat models for any identified adversaries. <br><br>\n\nThese various assessments and models should enable the defender to identify their strategic goal. At this point, all activities should be aligned with this goal. Once a goal has been selected, the defender must work to plan for the operation by identifying a target adversary, creating the necessary Personas, generating an operational storyboard, etc. Finally, the key stakeholders should be called on to establish rules for operational safety and acceptable risk.

The Understand goal helps the defender to assess their progress towards Strategic Goals. At its core, the Understand goal ensures that operational outputs can connect to and inform a larger strategy. To do this, the defender must turn the raw outputs from an operation into useful and actionable intelligence. These outputs may be in the form of collected PCAP, logs, qualitative defender observations, etc. Applying analytics to raw data can help the defender to map this data to adversary behavior. Now the behavior can be analyzed to contextualize the intelligence and inform the existing threat model. \n<br><br>\nFor example, the defender may look at raw PCAP data and identify a new IP address that the adversary uses for exfiltration. This IOC can be added to the existing threat model. After applying behavioral analytics to the data, the defender might see that the adversary used a new Defense Evasion technique. In that case, the defender should update the threat model to include this new intelligence. At this point, the defender should assess if this new intelligence will affect any ongoing operations. For example, the defender should ensure that current collection efforts will detect this new TTP. Other opportunities to increase the defender's understanding post-operation include efforts to refine and update individual engagement activities based on qualitative and quantitative outputs. The defender can reflect on how the overall engagement went and refine future activities to maximize the usefulness. \n<br><br>\nFinally, the defenders should assess their own coordination and communication. Teamwork is essential during an operation. The defender should seek to improve coordination and skills with each operation.
