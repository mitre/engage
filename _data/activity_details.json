story.", "long_description": "Decoy Artifacts and Systems allow the defender to increase the attack surface of their environment to expose more of the deception story. Additionally, they can be used to adjust the adversary\u2019s sense of ambiguity to increase or decrease their level of uncertainty towards the environment. Investigation of these decoy artifacts may introduce a resource cost on the adversary, enable or block the adversary's intended actions, encourage or discourage a specific action or response, etc. \n<br><br>\nDecoy artifacts can take a variety of forms including credentials, accounts, files/directories, browser extensions/bookmarks, system processes, etc. Decoy systems can be real, virtual, or simulated. They can be presented as one of a variety of IT devices, including user workstations, servers, networking systems, IOT (embedded devices), mobile devices, etc. Regardless of form, these decoy artifacts and systems provide a variety of opportunities for the defender. For example, decoy artifacts can be used as tripwires to produce a high-fidelity alert when accessed. \n<br><br>\nCareful planning should guide the creation and deployment of these tripwires to ensure effectiveness. For example, understanding the adversary's known TTPs will highlight which resources the adversary is likely to touch, and therefore where decoy artifacts should be placed. A thorough assessment of the defender's priority cyber assets and intellectual property should guide the placement of decoy artifacts used as tripwires. \n<br><br>\nA decoy artifact can provide several means to influence adversary activity. The following examples illustrate the powerful effects decoy artifacts and systems can have on the adversary. First, by planting decoy artifacts and systems that align with known adversary TTPs, the defender can influence adversary activities. For example, if a target adversary has a capability against a specific application, the defender can place this vulnerable application in the environment to motivate the adversary to exploit the decoy. \n<br><br>\nAs a second example, a defender may install AV or some other security or monitoring tool in a way that is easy for the adversary to remove. If an adversary removes the tool, they may be emboldened to act more openly believing they can\u2019t be monitored.  \n<br><br>\nThe defender can attempt to demotivate the adversary by strategically placing decoy artifacts. For example, a defender could place a selection of reverse engineering tools or monitoring applications on a known vulnerable target. This may sow confusion and raise ambiguity, demotivating the adversary\u2019s desire to go after that target even if it is vulnerable. \n<br><br>\nPlanting decoy artifacts and systems in the environment can influence the adversary to reveal the extent of successive campaigns against a target. For example, the defender can make and leak fake credentials both inside and outside of the network. The defender can then monitor for the use of these credentials. Then, when an adversary uses a fake credential, the defender will receive a high-fidelity alert. If the credentials are unique, a defender may be able to detect how and when an adversary collected the credentials. \n<br><br>\nFinally, decoy artifacts can be used to impose a resource cost on the adversary. For example, the defender can create an especially enticing, but excessively large, decoy file that is time and resource consuming to exfiltrate from the target.", "EAV0001": [{"name": "Credential

For example, the defender can manipulate software by changing the output of commonly used discovery commands to hide legitimate systems and artifacts and/or reveal decoy artifacts and systems. \n<br><br>\nAlternatively, the defender can change the output of the password policy description for an adversary attempting to brute-force credentials. This manipulation may cause the adversary to waste resources brute-forcing passwords with inaccurate complexity requirements. If the defender wanted to degrade software effectiveness, they might weaken algorithms to expose data that is being archived, encoded, and/or encrypted. \n<br><br>\nFinally, to prevent software from functioning altogether, the defender may cause software typically used to delete data or hide adversary artifacts to fail. For some Software Manipulation use cases, it may be possible to make changes in such a way that adversary actions and legitimate user actions are handled differently. For example, the defender could show all files when viewed in a graphical application but hide files or introduce decoy files when viewed via a terminal command. This would allow legitimate users full access to the file system while adversaries using a reverse shell to access the target would see the manipulated the files.", "EAV0016": [{"name": "Command and Control", "id": "TA0011"}, {"name": "Collection", "id": "TA0009"}, {"name": "Defense Evasion", "id": "TA0005"}, {"name": "Discovery", "id": "TA0007"}, {"name": "Execution", "id": "TA0002"}, {"name": "Lateral Movement", "id": "TA0008"}, {"name": "Privilege Escalation", "id": "TA0004"}, {"name": "Impact", "id": "TA0040"}, {"name": "Persistence", "id": "TA0003"}], "EAV0001": [{"name": "Discovery", "id": "TA0007"}, {"name": "Privilege Escalation", "id": "TA0004"}, {"name": "Impact", "id": "TA0040"}], "EAV0007": [{"name": "Discovery", "id": "TA0007"}], "EAV0019": [{"name": "Discovery", "id": "TA0007"}], "EAV0010": [{"name": "Initial Access", "id": "TA0001"}], "EAV0022": [{"name": "Credential Access", "id": "TA0006"}], "EAV0013": [{"name": "Persistence", "id": "TA0003"}, {"name": "Defense Evasion", "id": "TA0005"}]}, "EAC0015": {"type": "Engagement", "goals": ["EGO0003"], "vulnerabilities": [{"eav": "When adversaries discover a diverse set of accessible resources and decoy artifacts on the target, they are vulnerable to revealing their targeting preferences and capabilities.", "id": "EAV0019"}, {"eav": "When adversaries interact with the environment or personas, they are vulnerable when they collect, observe, or manipulate system artifacts or information.

Conversely, if the adversary checks the timestamps on various files on the target and finds timestamps going back multiple years, they may trust that the environment is legitimate even if, in reality, the files are new and the timestamps were falsified.

For example, if an adversary begins to use the engagement environment as a platform to operate against other targets, stakeholders may decide that the operation must be suspended until the unacceptable traffic can be blocked. Defining Exit Criteria is an essential step to ensure operational safety."}, "SAC0006": {"type": "Strategic", "goals": ["SGO0002"], "vulnerabilities": [], "attack_techniques": [], "attack_tactics": [], "approaches": ["SAP0002"], "name": "Hotwash", "description": "Review the retrospective of operational activities.", "long_description": "The Hotwash is the opportunity for the team to review the events of the operation to ensure progress towards strategic outcomes. This retrospective can include a review of the entire operational process from planning, implementation, engagement activity, and impact. In additional to the operation itself, the Hotwash is an important time to assess the communication and teamwork of the operations team and all contributing stakeholders. While a Hotwash should always occur at the end of an operation, periodic hotwashes during long-running operations are vital to ensure alignment and progress towards the Strategic Goal."}, "SAC0007": {"type": "Strategic", "goals": ["SGO0002"], "vulnerabilities": [], "attack_techniques": [], "attack_tactics": [], "approaches": ["SAP0002"], "name": "Refine Operation Activities", "description": "Update and improve the implementation of operational activities to better achieve the strategic goal.", "long_description": "Refine Operation Activities refers to the process of updating and improving the technical implementation of operational activities. Activities are the means by which defenders drive progress towards approaches and ultimately goals. Therefore, it is essential to continue to refine and improve these activities based on operational experiences. This refinement can inform future operations or be used to improve a running operation. For example, suppose a password that was intended to be easy to crack has stumped multiple brute-forcing sessions. It may be time to change the password to something simpler or reassess if that path for movement in the environment is still necessary."}, "SAC0008": {"type": "Strategic", "goals": ["SGO0002"], "vulnerabilities": [], "attack_techniques": [], "attack_tactics": [], "approaches": ["SAP0002"], "name": "Distill Intelligence", "description": "Turn raw data gained during an operation into actionable intelligence.", "long_description": "Distill Intelligence refers to the process of taking the raw data collected during an operation and producing actionable intelligence. This raw data can take the form of collected logs, PCAP, malware, etc. The process of analyzing data can rely on manual or automatic processing. \n<br><br>\nOne key method of Distilling Intelligence is the use of data analytics. Data analytics allows the defender to map the raw data collected during an operation to the adversary behavior that generated it. To remain useful at scale, automated analytics, such as behavioral analytics, are essential to produce meaningful intelligence.

Updates may include revising knowledge of adversary TTPs, IOCs, etc. Whenever the threat model is updated, it is essential to revisit any operational decisions that were made using the old threat model. Revisiting operational decisions is particularly important when the update to the threat model is related to new TTPs. \n<br><br>\nFor example, suppose an adversary is observed demonstrating a previously unknown TTP. Any operation currently focused on this threat should be reassessed. Defenders should ensure that collection is adequate to monitor this new TTP and continue to ensure operational safety.
