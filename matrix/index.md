The Engage Matrix displays the relationships between the various Strategic and Engagement Goals, Approaches, and Activities. Goals are found at the top row of Engage. Each Approach and Activity is assigned to a goal. Approaches are the next row down. All Activities are assigned to an Approach. Finally, Activities make up the remaining entries in Engage. Strategic Actions can be found in the far right and far left columns of Engage. Engagement Actions can be found in the central columns. By bookending Engagement Actions with Strategic Planning and Analysis, we hope that MITRE Engage&trade; will help organizations better plan and implement real-world adversary engagement strategies and advance the cybersecurity ecosystem.
