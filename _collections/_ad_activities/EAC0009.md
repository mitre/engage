description: "Modify the flow of email in the environment."
long_description: "Email Manipulation covers the various ways email flows in the environment can be affected. Email Manipulation can affect which mail appliances process mail flows, where mail is forwarded, or what mail is present in an inbox. A common use case for email manipulation is as a vector to introduce malware into the engagement environment. 
<br><br>
Suspicious emails may be removed from production mailbox and placed into an inbox in an engagement environment. Then, any suspicious attachments or links could be detonated from within the environment. As another example, emails collected over a long period of time from a legitimate inbox outside the environment may be moved into the environment to reassure the adversary of the environmentâ€™s legitimacy by creating a mailbox that more closely resembles a real, lived-in inbox."
