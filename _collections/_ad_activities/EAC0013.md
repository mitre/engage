_name: "Detonate Malware"
description: "Execute malware under controlled conditions to analyze its functionality."
long_description: "Malware can be detonated in a controlled and safe environment. Clear goals and safety procedures should always be established before detonation to ensure that the operation is focused and safe. The malware can be detonated in an execution environment ranging from a somewhat sterile commercial malware execution appliance to a bespoke engagement environment crafted to support an extended engagement. 
<br><br>
Outcomes of a malware detonation operation can include new IOCs collected during dynamic analysis, additional TTPs elicited by detonating the malware in a target rich environment, and/or negative impacts to the adversary and their operation. These outcomes can be used to produce new analytics for high-fidelity analytics."
