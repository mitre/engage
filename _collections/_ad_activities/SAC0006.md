description: "Review the retrospective of operational activities."
long_description: "The Hotwash is the opportunity for the team to review the events of the operation to ensure progress towards strategic outcomes. This retrospective can include a review of the entire operational process from planning, implementation, engagement activity, and impact. In additional to the operation itself, the Hotwash is an important time to assess the communication and teamwork of the operations team and all contributing stakeholders. While a Hotwash should always occur at the end of an operation, periodic hotwashes during long-running operations are vital to ensure alignment and progress towards the Strategic Goal."
