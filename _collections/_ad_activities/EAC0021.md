_name: "Migrate Attack Vector"
description: "Move a malicious link, file, or device from its intended location to a decoy system or network for execution/use."
long_description: "When a defender Migrates an Attack Vector, the defender intercepts a malicious element and moves it to a safe environment, such as a decoy system within a decoy network, for continued engagement or analysis. A defender may choose to migrate attack vectors, which may appear in the form of phishing emails, suspicious email attachments, or malicious USBs. For example, a defender might move a suspicious attachment from a corporate inbox to an inbox on a system that, while in the corporate IP space, is completely segmented from the enterprise network. This segregated environment will allow the adversary to move laterally throughout the environment without risk to enterprise resources. 
<br><br>
Determining when an engagement should be moved to an engagement environment is a critical decision when calculating acceptable operational risk. However, if the adversary sent a custom malware sample to a phishing victim, but ultimately find themselves on an unrelated victim, they may be suspicious. Balancing this acceptable risk, believability, and operational goals is essential when determining if or when to migrate an attack vector."
