description: "Place data on a system to reinforce the legitimacy of the system or user."
long_description: "Pocket Litter is data placed on a system to convince an adversary that the system and users are real. Pocket Litter can be used to establish a cognitive bias to raise the adversary's tolerance to weaknesses in the environment. Unlike Decoy Artifacts, Pocket Litter does not necessarily aim to encourage the adversary to take a specific action, but rather it supports the overall deception story.
<br><br>
Pocket Litter can include documents, pictures, registry entries, installed software, log history, browsing history, connection history, and other user data that an adversary would expect to exist on a user's computer. For example, a defender might conduct a series of web searches to generate browser artifacts, or scatter a variety of photos and documents across the desktop to make the computer feel lived in."
