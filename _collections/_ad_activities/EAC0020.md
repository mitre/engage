description: "Configure devices, systems, networks, etc. to contain activity and data, thus preventing the expansion an engagement beyond desired limits."
long_description: "Using Isolation, a defender can limit the effectiveness and scope of malicious activity and/or lower exposure to unintended risks. When a system or resource is isolated, a defender can observe adversary behaviors or tools without allowing lateral movement. For example, a defender may detonate a piece of malware on an isolated system to perform dynamic analysis without risk to other network resources.

Determining which systems should be isolated in an operation is a critical decision when calculating acceptable operational risk. However, if the adversary expects to find an entire corporate network but instead finds only an isolated system, they may not be interested in engaging with the target. Balancing acceptable risk, believability, and operational goals is essential when determining if or when a system should be isolated."
