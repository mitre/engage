description: "Conceal and reveal both facts and fictions to support a deception story"
long_description: "Information Manipulation is used to support the deception story. Revealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the adversary’s trust in the environment. Concealed facts and fiction can be used to adjust the adversary’s sense of uncertainty towards the environment. Revealed facts may include OS type and version, geographic location, hardware type and version, accounts, credentials, etc. Revealed fictions may include the content of decoy files, emails, messages, etc. Revealed facts and fictions may or may not be believed by the adversary.
<br><br>
If an adversary believes a revealed fact or fiction, it may lend credibility to the environment or encourage a specific action. If an adversary is suspicious or does not believe a revealed fact or fiction, it may erode adversary trust in the environment. For example, if the adversary discovers that a collection of legitimate passwords all contain the phrase \"honeytoken\" or \"canarytoken\" they may lose trust in the legitimacy of the environment, even if the credentials are real and valid in the enterprise network. Conversely, if the adversary checks the timestamps on various files on the target and finds timestamps going back multiple years, they may trust that the environment is legitimate even if, in reality, the files are new and the timestamps were falsified. In this way, revealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the adversary's trust in the environment in ways that support the defender's goals. 
<br><br>
Concealed facts may include virtualized systems disguised as physical systems, monitoring software, or collection efforts. Concealed fictions may include an encrypted, interestingly named, decoy file or a partially deleted email thread referencing high value, but decoy, assets. Concealed facts and fictions may or may not be discovered by the adversary. If the adversary discovers a concealed fact or fiction, it may increase the ambiguity of the environment and affect the adversary's sense of uncertainty. 
<br><br>
For example, if an adversary discovers a hidden monitoring solution is deployed, they may feel less comfortable engaging with that specific target. Conversely, if the defender deploys a hidden monitoring solution with an intentional blind spot that the adversary discovers, the adversary may feel a decrease in ambiguity and take additional actions believing that they will be undetected. In this way, concealed facts and fictions can be used to adjust the ambiguity and affect the adversary's sense of uncertainty in ways that support the defender's goals."
