long_description: "Refine Operation Activities refers to the process of updating and improving the technical implementation of operational activities. Activities are the means by which defenders drive progress towards approaches and ultimately goals. Therefore, it is essential to continue to refine and improve these activities based on operational experiences. This refinement can inform future operations or be used to improve a running operation. For example, suppose a password that was intended to be easy to crack has stumped multiple brute-forcing sessions. It may be time to change the password to something simpler or reassess if that path for movement in the environment is still necessary."
