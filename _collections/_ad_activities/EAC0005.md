description: "Introduce impersonations to expand the scope of a deceptive story."
long_description: "Decoy Artifacts and Systems allow the defender to increase the attack surface of their environment to expose more of the deception story. Additionally, they can be used to adjust the adversary’s sense of ambiguity to increase or decrease their level of uncertainty towards the environment. Investigation of these decoy artifacts may introduce a resource cost on the adversary, enable or block the adversary's intended actions, encourage or discourage a specific action or response, etc. 
<br><br>
Decoy artifacts can take a variety of forms including credentials, accounts, files/directories, browser extensions/bookmarks, system processes, etc. Decoy systems can be real, virtual, or simulated. They can be presented as one of a variety of IT devices, including user workstations, servers, networking systems, IOT (embedded devices), mobile devices, etc. Regardless of form, these decoy artifacts and systems provide a variety of opportunities for the defender. For example, decoy artifacts can be used as tripwires to produce a high-fidelity alert when accessed. 
<br><br>
Careful planning should guide the creation and deployment of these tripwires to ensure effectiveness. For example, understanding the adversary's known TTPs will highlight which resources the adversary is likely to touch, and therefore where decoy artifacts should be placed. A thorough assessment of the defender's priority cyber assets and intellectual property should guide the placement of decoy artifacts used as tripwires. 
<br><br>
A decoy artifact can provide several means to influence adversary activity. The following examples illustrate the powerful effects decoy artifacts and systems can have on the adversary. First, by planting decoy artifacts and systems that align with known adversary TTPs, the defender can influence adversary activities. For example, if a target adversary has a capability against a specific application, the defender can place this vulnerable application in the environment to motivate the adversary to exploit the decoy. 
<br><br>
As a second example, a defender may install AV or some other security or monitoring tool in a way that is easy for the adversary to remove. If an adversary removes the tool, they may be emboldened to act more openly believing they can’t be monitored.  
<br><br>
The defender can attempt to demotivate the adversary by strategically placing decoy artifacts. For example, a defender could place a selection of reverse engineering tools or monitoring applications on a known vulnerable target. This may sow confusion and raise ambiguity, demotivating the adversary’s desire to go after that target even if it is vulnerable. 
<br><br>
Planting decoy artifacts and systems in the environment can influence the adversary to reveal the extent of successive campaigns against a target. For example, the defender can make and leak fake credentials both inside and outside of the network. The defender can then monitor for the use of these credentials. Then, when an adversary uses a fake credential, the defender will receive a high-fidelity alert. If the credentials are unique, a defender may be able to detect how and when an adversary collected the credentials. 
<br><br>
Finally, decoy artifacts can be used to impose a resource cost on the adversary. For example, the defender can create an especially enticing, but excessively large, decoy file that is time and resource consuming to exfiltrate from the target."
