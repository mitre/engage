description: "Deep Panda is a suspected Chinese threat group known to target many industries, including government, defense, financial, and telecommunications.  The intrusion into healthcare company Anthem has been attributed to Deep Panda.  This group is also known as Shell Crew, WebMasters, KungFu Kittens, and PinkPanther.  Deep Panda also appears to be known as Black Vine based on the attribution of both group names to the Anthem intrusion.  Some analysts track Deep Panda and APT19 as the same group, but it is unclear from open source information if the groups are the same. "
