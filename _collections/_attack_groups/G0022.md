description: "APT3 is a China-based threat group that researchers have attributed to China's Ministry of State Security.   This group is responsible for the campaigns known as Operation Clandestine Fox, Operation Clandestine Wolf, and Operation Double Tap.   As of June 2015, the group appears to have shifted from targeting primarily US victims to primarily political organizations in Hong Kong. 

MITRE has also developed an APT3 Adversary Emulation Plan."
