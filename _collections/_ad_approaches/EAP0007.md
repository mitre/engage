description: "Encourage an adversary to conduct part or all of their mission."
long_description: "Motivation is used to encourage an adversary to conduct part or all of their mission by providing a target-rich environment. To do this, the defender can use unpatched versions of operating systems and software, remove end-point detection software, and use weak passwords. Additionally, the defender can open firewall ports, add proxy capabilities, or introduce elements that an adversary can easily leverage to bypass an obstacle in their operations. Finally, the defender can include enticing data to the environment to encourage the adversary to steal the data."
