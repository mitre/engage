description: "Gather adversary tools, observe tactics, and collect other raw intelligence about the adversary's activity."
long_description: "Collection is used to gather information about an adversary or their activities. This collection can include gathering system logs, network traffic, adversary artifacts, or other data that can be used to expose adversary activity. In many cases, Collection activities are also good cybersecurity practices. However, in Engage, these activities will focus exclusively on the intersection of denial, deception, and adversary engagement technologies and the defenderâ€™s ability to Expose the adversary."
